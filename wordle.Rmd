## PRELIMINARIES

Load in Modules and data

```
{r}
collins <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt", header=TRUE)
google <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt", header=TRUE)
```

## STEP ONE

Creating a function called load_dictionary() that takes a single argument, "filename", that can be used to read in either of the two data files just downloaded. 

```
{r}
load_dictionary <- function(fileurl) {
      read.table(fileurl, header=TRUE)
}
```

Use function to create solution_list and valid_list 

```
{r}
valid_list <- load_dictionary("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt")
solution_list <- load_dictionary("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt")
```
Then just a quick test of the lists to confirm they worked:
```
{r}
str(valid_list)
str(solution_list)
```

Then I converted them to vectors for ease of work later
```
{r}
solution_list <- solution_list$words
valid_list <- valid_list$words
```

## STEP TWO

Filtering the solution_list to only include words in the valid_list using intersect. 

```
{r}
solution_list <- intersect (solution_list, valid_list)
```

## STEP THREE
This function does a few things: removes solutions from d that are not 5 letters in length, then chooses a word, then splits it into a vector of single-character elements

```
{r}
"pick_solution <- function(list) {
      possible_answers <- filter (list, nchar (list) == 5)
      answer <- sample (possible_answers, 1, replace = FALSE) 
      answer_split <- strsplit (answer,"") [[1]]
}
```

Now we run the function to see if it works:

```
{r}
solution <- pick_solution(solution_list)
```
